To install a solid Ubuntu with working grub, mouse, 
touchpad and wi-fi on MacBook with said configuration 
I have used a distribution from GitHub repo(https://github.com/marcosfad/mbp-ubuntu), 
where Ubuntu versions for T2 MacBook are posted. 
I've installed release v20.04-5.7.19-1 (download an ISO image, 
write it on USB stick with balenaEtcher, 
create a new disk partition for second OS, 
enable booting from external media, 
then run Ubuntu Live and use Ubiquity to install). 

To enable wi-fi I followed steps proposed AdityaGarg8(https://github.com/marcosfad/mbp-ubuntu/issues/46):

install necessary kernel modules with DKMS(https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/dkms/)
upgrade kernel from v5.13.12-1(https://github.com/AdityaGarg8/T2-Big-Sur-Ubuntu-Kernel/releases/tag/v5.13.12-1)

follow this guide(https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/wifi/)
After that I have Ubuntu running without problem on Mac with configuration that described in the question.
